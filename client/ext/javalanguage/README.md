# Cloud9 IDE Java Language Features

## TODOs

* EclipseClient protocol exhaustive testing
* General: Substitute the user's workspace in the EclipseClient creation
* Refactor: Adjust placeholder to take (positions + lengths and where to adjust) to be able to mark imports
* Variable locations : the constructor is marked as a use --> not declaration
* Refactor: pressing enter key should also do the refactoring and pressing escape should cancel the refactoring
* Refactor: changed files must be noted !! --> maybe need a tree reload action

## Major Remaining Tasks

* processor.analyze -> build and get error markers
